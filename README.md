# The-Predator-Prey-Model
First Deep Learning Project
The predator-prey model is a foundational ecological concept, describing the dynamic relationship between two interdependent species - the predator and the prey. This model has numerous applications in fields ranging from biology and environmental science to economics and game theory. By understanding the intricate balance between predators and their prey, we can gain valuable insights into the complex web of interactions that shape our natural world.
